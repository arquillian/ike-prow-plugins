== Development

=== Build

In order to compile the project simply execute `make build` target. This will compile, run tests and put binaries of each
plugin in `/bin` directory in the root of the project. There is also a quick compile option (`make compile-only`) where
`go build` is only invoked, skipping other targets like `tests` and `checks`

You can also automatically format and remove unused imports by invoking `goimports` tool (`make imports`).

IMPORTANT: `goimports` does not correctly handle import of packages where package name differs from last part of the URL
provided. For example `import "gopkg.in/h2non/gock.v1"` will be removed. To overcome this problem name the import `import gock "gopkg.in/h2non/gock.v1"`. One of the related issues link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9882[go/issues/9882].

To deploy plugins use `make oc-deploy-plugins`. This will build images, push them to the repository, generate deployments and apply
them on the cluster. This target builds all plugins at once.

IMPORTANT: You have to be logged in to the cluster first.

=== Developing new plugin

Besides creating new folders/packages in `plugin` folder you will have to register your plugin in the `Makefile`. Simply
add its name to link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/308909d88c7bee02b96236121fd25d4e9d08d88b/Makefile#L4[this list] and you should be good.

IMPORTANT: By convention internal `PluginName`, the directory where the code is located and name of the service are assumed to
be the same.

=== Testing

We use link:https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/[Ginkgo] testing framework and link:https://onsi.github.io/gomega/[Gomega] assertion library for writing tests.

Make sure you have both installed locally in order to execute tests from the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get -u github.com/onsi/gomega
----

==== Testing hints

* To run all tests at once execute `ginkgo -r` on the root of the project.
* `ginkgo watch -r` will watch on tests changes recursively starting from the directory the command was invoked. It will re-run the tests whenever change in the code occurs
* In order to execute one test rename `It` function to `FIt`. Ginkgo runner will only execute given test (focused) instead of the whole test suite. This also works with `Context` and `Describe` blocks.
* To exclude prefix any of the blocks with `X`.

==== Testing hooks [[testing-hooks]]

You can consume GitHub events through webhook pointing to your local cluster. For this purpose use
link:http://www.ultrahook.com/[`ultrahook`]. After registering your own API key simply run following command and you
are all set:

[source,bash]
----
ultrahook github http://$(oc get route/hook --no-headers=true -o=custom-columns=HOST:spec.host)/hook
----

NOTE: If not done before add ultrahook URL as payload URL for webhook configuration (see <<webhook>>).

Having this set up you will start seeing events triggered by your actions in the repository and
corresponding plugins reacting on them. Have a look at pods logs to verify if everything is working expected.


=== Local Setup using Minishift

You can use Minishift for developing plugins locally.
Follow link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#installing-instructions[official installation guide] to set it up.

This setup is based on following versions:

[source,bash]
----
minishift v1.13.1
openshift v3.7.1
kubernetes v1.7.6
----

To start your Minishift cluster you can use following command (you might want to customize CPU and memory limits):

[source,bash]
----
minishift start --profile prow --memory 8GB --cpus 4
----

==== Initial setup

Before you start developing new plugins or evolving existing ones you need to deploy set of basic Prow services and configuration.

For this purpose use login to your OpenShift cluster using `oc login` and execute `make oc-init-project` target which will:

* Create new project named `ike-prow-plugins`
* Add config maps for Prow configuration (`config.yaml`) and its plugins (`plugins.yaml`)
* Add required secrets (see <<gh-settings>> for details)

At this point you have new Openshift project created and before you will be able to deploy plugins you need to run the target `oc-deploy-hook` that will deploy `hook` service responsible for listening to GitHub events and dispatching them to relevant plugins.

==== Pushing to local Minishift repository

To speed up development cycle (and avoid pushing work-in-progress) images to Docker Hub you can use built-in docker repository available in Minishift.
`Makefile` and templates are adjusted to use it, so the only thing you have to do is to set up few environment variables.

IMPORTANT: Before executing `docker login` make sure you are logged in using token instead of regular password. That's returned
by `oc whoami -t` and is used as password by Docker daemon. To do that open OpenShift Console (e.g. `xdg-open https://$(minishift ip):8443/console &>/dev/null`),
click on your username in the upper-right corner and then `Copy Login Command`. Use it to login from the terminal and
you are ready to go.

==== Hints

You can simplify your setup by seeding configuration files

[source,bash]
.Seeding tokens
----
include::../local.sh[tag=seeding_secrets]
----

<1> Your GitHub Webhook secret. See for more details <<gh-settings>>.
<2> Your user (or bot account) GitHub OAuth Token. See for more details <<gh-settings>>.
<3> link:https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#about-the-dsn[Sentry DSN] in `+https://<key>:<secret>@<sentry_host>/<project>+` format.

NOTE: If you are using `zsh` you can take a look at link:https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv[autoenv] or
link:https://direnv.net/[direnv] to automate this setup every time you access project's directory. Just make sure to add it to your global `.gitignore` to avoid sharing it through PRs (e.g. `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`).
