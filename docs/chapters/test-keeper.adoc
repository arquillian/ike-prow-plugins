== Test Keeper plugin

This plugin can help you stick to the rule that every feature you ship comes with automated way of assuring it works - by using automated tests.
If it won't find any tests in the Pull Request, it adds a comment with a description and marks its check as **Failure**, or as **Success** otherwise (see the screenshots below):

image::test-keeper-success.png[Success, title="Success status"]

image::test-keeper-failure.png[Failure, title="Failure status"]

This check is done based on the file name patterns - for more information head over to <<test-keeper-config>> part.

The plugin is triggered when the Pull Request is opened/reopened or updated by new or removed commit.

If, for whatever reason, you want to bypass this check - simply comment using `const:pkg/plugin/test-keeper/comment_cmd.go[name="BypassCheckComment"]` command. If you are an admin user or requested PR reviewer but not a creator of the PR you will see the **Success** status.
If the comment will be later removed the check is triggered again.

=== How does it work? [[test-keeper-how]]

Test Keeper looks into the files in your Pull Request and checks if any tests were added or modified based on common naming patterns (we don't analyze source code yet...).

In addition, if a PR contains only "non-production" changeset, it won't be checked for test presence. By "non-production" changes we mean things like:

 * documentation
 * build assets (dependency files, build definition)
 * shell scripts
 * visual assets (images, styles, HTML templates)
 * common configuration files

Of course, all of it is configurable.

We have few reasonable defaults, which you can check link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/master/pkg/assets/config/test-keeper.yaml[here].

NOTE: If we missed some important patterns feel free to open an link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/issues/new[issue] or better yet - a link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/pulls/new[Pull request]!

=== Plugin Configuration [[test-keeper-config]]

To configure Test Keeper plugin place `test-keeper.yml` (or `test-keeper.yaml`) file inside of the directory `.ike-prow/` in your project and use properties described below.

.test-keeper.yaml
[source, yml, indent=0]
----
include::../../pkg/plugin/test-keeper/test_fixtures/github_calls/prs/with_tests/test-keeper.yml[]
----

<1> Defines set of <<file-patterns, file patterns>> which will be used to match files changeset and determine if Pull Requests comes with any changed test files.
<2> These <<file-patterns, file patterns>> will be used against changeset in the Pull Requests to exclude files that don't have to be verified by any test. If only such files exists the check will be marked as "Success" as no tests are expected for such a PR.
<3> Allows you to decide if you want to combine your patterns with predefined defaults (`true` by default).

IMPORTANT: The configuration file is always loaded from the `HEAD` of the Pull Request.

==== File patterns [[file-patterns]]

Both inclusions and exclusions can be specified in two formats - either in a wildcard format or in a regex.

===== Wildcard format
Wildcard format represents the whole file path using a combination of a star wildcard:

`**`:: wildcard for expressing "any directory"
`*`:: wildcard for expressing "any file name"

**Examples**

`**/*_test.go`:: matches any subdirectory containing a go file whose name ends with `_test`
`*_test.go`:: is same as the previous one - just a shorter version
`pkg/**/*_test.go`:: matches all `pkg` subdirectories containing a Go file whose name ends with `_test`
`vendor/`:: matches directory `vendor` and all its subdirectories and files located in it

===== Regular expressions

IMPORTANT: Don't use a regular expression inside of the wildcard format. We don't support it.

If the wildcard format is not suitable for you, you can still use regex, but it has to be surrounded by `regex{{...}}`.

Both formats can used together in list of patterns, e.g.:

[source, yml, indent=0]
----
test_patterns:
  - '**/__test.go'
  - 'regex{{.*test\.ts[x]?}}'
----

=== Status message

When there is a PR submitted without any test logic changed, then plugin (apart form setting the failure status) adds a comment explaining what is wrong and what the developer/reviewer can do.
If the PR is then either

 * updated by a commit that contains a test

or

 * updated so it contains only those files which the validation should be skipped for

then the status message in the comment is updated respectively to reflect the latest state of the PR.

==== Custom status message

Any of the status messages can be changed by putting the required custom message to any of the following files:

 * `test-keeper_without_tests_message.md` for the case when no test is added
 * `test-keeper_with_tests_message.md` for the case when PR is updated by a commit containing a test
 * `test-keeper_only_skipped_message.md` for the case when PR is updated so it contains only those files which the validation should be skipped for

IMPORTANT: All of them has to be located in the directory `.ike-prow/`

=== Status details

In this section, you can find status details description applicable for each state of the `test-keeper` plugin.
