==== Failed [[wip-failed]]

Your Pull Request has been rejected because the plugin detected that either the PR title starts with one of the "work in progress prefixes" or has the "work-in-progress" label (both of them are <<index#work-in-progress-config, configurable>>), so it seems that there is still an ongoing work.

When the PR is done and ready for review and merge, then remove the prefix from the title or the "work-in-progress" label to make the status green. Removing the prefix also triggers removing the added GitHub "work-in-progress" label from the PR and vice-versa.
