== Test Keeper plugin

This plugin can help you stick to the rule that every feature you ship comes with automated way of assuring it works - by using automated tests.
If it won't find any tests in the Pull Request, it adds a comment with a description and marks its check as **Failure**, or as **Success** otherwise (see the screenshots below):

image::test-keeper-success.png[Success, title="Success status"]

image::test-keeper-failure.png[Failure, title="Failure status"]

This check is done based on the file name patterns - for more information head over to <<test-keeper-config>> part.

The plugin is triggered when the Pull Request is opened/reopened or updated by new or removed commit.

If, for whatever reason, you want to bypass this check - simply comment using `const:pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/comment_cmd.go[name="BypassCheckComment"]` command. If you are an admin user or requested PR reviewer but not a creator of the PR you will see the **Success** status.
If the comment will be later removed the check is triggered again.

=== How does it work? [[test-keeper-how]]

Test Keeper looks into the files in your Pull Request and checks if any tests were added or modified based on common naming patterns (we don't analyze source code yet...).

In addition, if a PR contains only "non-production" changeset, it won't be checked for test presence. By "non-production" changes we mean things like:

 * documentation
 * build assets (dependency files, build definition)
 * shell scripts
 * visual assets (images, styles, HTML templates)
 * common configuration files

Of course, all of it is configurable.

We have few reasonable defaults, which you can check link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/master/pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/test-keeper.yaml[here].

NOTE: If we missed some important patterns feel free to open an link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/issues/new[issue] or better yet - a link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/pulls/new[Pull request]!

=== Plugin Configuration [[test-keeper-config]]

To configure Test Keeper plugin place `test-keeper.yml` (or `test-keeper.yaml`) file in the root of your project and use properties described below.

[source, yml, indent=0]
----
include::../../pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/test_fixtures/github_calls/prs/with_tests/test-keeper.yml[]
----

<1> Defines set of <<file-patterns, file patterns>> which will be used to match files changeset and determine if Pull Requests comes with any changed test files.
<2> These <<file-patterns, file patterns>> will be used against changeset in the Pull Requests to exclude files that don't have to be verified by any test. If only such files exists the check will be marked as "Success" as no tests are expected for such a PR.
<3> Allows you to decide if you want to combine your patterns with predefined defaults (`true` by default).
<4> Sets plugin hint comment message to be added to the Pull Request when no test is found. It can be set either as a relative path or absolute URL to a file that contains a plugin hint and having case insensitive filename PLUGIN_NAME_HINT.md  
or as an inline string comment. (if nothing is set then a link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/tree/master/pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/comment_message.go[default message] is used).

IMPORTANT: Both the configuration file and the file with plugin hint are always loaded from the `HEAD` of the Pull Request.

==== File patterns [[file-patterns]]

Both inclusions and exclusions can be specified in two formats - either in a wildcard format or in a regex.

===== Wildcard format
Wildcard format represents the whole file path using a combination of a star wildcard:

`**`:: wildcard for expressing "any directory"
`*`:: wildcard for expressing "any file name"

**Examples**

`**/*_test.go`:: matches any subdirectory containing a go file whose name ends with `_test`
`*_test.go`:: is same as the previous one - just a shorter version
`pkg/**/*_test.go`:: matches all `pkg` subdirectories containing a Go file whose name ends with `_test`
`vendor/`:: matches directory `vendor` and all its subdirectories and files located in it

===== Regular expressions

IMPORTANT: Don't use a regular expression inside of the wildcard format. We don't support it.

If the wildcard format is not suitable for you, you can still use regex, but it has to be surrounded by `regex{{...}}`.

Both formats can used together in list of patterns, e.g.:

[source, yml, indent=0]
----
test_patterns:
  - '**/__test.go'
  - 'regex{{.*test\.ts[x]?}}'
----

=== Status details

==== Success - test is present [[tests-exist]]

Your Pull Request has been approved because the plugin detected a test file that has been added or changed in the PR.

It means that changeset in this PR has files matching any of the default test patterns, those you configured  or by a combination of both.

For more information about the behavior and what the default file patterns are, see <<test-keeper-how>> section. If you need to reconfigure the plugin then read the section <<test-keeper-config>>.

==== Success - no test needed [[only-skipped]]

Your Pull Request has been approved because it seems that it doesn't need to have additional tests. All changed files in the changeset match patterns for which the validation should be skipped.

For more information about the behavior and what the default file patterns are, see <<test-keeper-how>> section. If you need to reconfigure the plugin then read the section <<test-keeper-config>>.

==== Success - approved by [[keeper-approved-by]]

Your Pull Request has been approved by any of the administrators or reviewers despite the fact that it has no test.

If the PR contains only "non-production" changeset and some of them haven't been detected by any file patterns the validation should be skipped for, you can add them in your configuration file.

For more information see <<test-keeper-how>> and <<test-keeper-config>> sections.

==== Failed [[no-tests]]

Your Pull Request has been rejected because the plugin wasn't able to find any added or changed test file in the change-set.

Automated tests give us confidence in shipping reliable software. Please add some as part of this change.

If you are an admin and you are sure that no test is needed then you can use a command `const:pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/comment_cmd.go[name="BypassCheckComment"]` as a comment to make the status green.

For more information about the behavior, how the test files are detected and what the default file patterns are, see <<test-keeper-how>> section.
If you need to reconfigure the plugin then read the section <<test-keeper-config>>.
