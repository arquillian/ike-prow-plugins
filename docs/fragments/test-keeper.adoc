== Test Keeper plugin

This plugin can help you stick to the rule that every feature you ship comes with automated way of assuring it works - by using automated tests. 
If it won't find any tests in the Pull Request, it adds a comment with a description and marks its check as **Failure**, or as **Success** otherwise (see the screenshots below):

image::testkeeper-success.png[Success, title="Success status"]

image::testkeeper-failure.png[Failure, title="Failure status"]

This check is done based on the file name patterns - for more information head over to <<testkeeper-config>> part.
  
The plugin is triggered when the Pull Request is opened/reopened or updated by new or removed commit.

If, for whatever reason, you want to bypass this check - simply comment using `const:pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/event_handler.go[name="SkipComment"]` command. If you are an admin user you will see the **Success** status.
If the comment will be later removed the check is triggered again.

=== How does it work?

Test Keeper looks into the files in your Pull Request and checks if any tests were added or modified based on common naming patterns (we don't analyze source code yet...).

In addition, if a PR contains only "non-production" changeset, it won't be checked for test presence. By "non-production" changes we mean things like:

 * documentation
 * build assets (dependency files, build definition)
 * shell scripts
 * visual assets (images, styles, HTML templates)
 * common configuration files

Of course, all of it is configurable.

We have few reasonable defaults, which you can check link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/master/pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/test-keeper.yaml[here].

NOTE: If we missed some important patterns feel free to open an link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/issues/new[issue] or better yet - a link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/pulls/new[Pull request]!

=== Plugin Configuration [[testkeeper-config]]

To configure Test Keeper plugin place `test-keeper.yml` (or `test-keeper.yaml`) file in the root of your project and use properties described below.

[source, yml, indent=0]
----
include::../../pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/test_fixtures/github_calls/prs/with_tests/test-keeper.yml[]
----

<1> Defines set of <<file-patterns, file patterns>> which will be used to match files changeset and determine if Pull Requests comes with any changed test files.
<2> These <<file-patterns, file patterns>> will be used against changeset in the Pull Requests to exclude files that don't have to be verified by any test. If only such files exists the check will be marked as "Success" as no tests are expected for such a PR.
<3> Allows you to decide if you want to combine your patterns with predefined defaults (`true` by default).
<4> Sets either relative path or absolute URL to a file that contains a plugin hint to be added to the Pull Request when no test is found (if nothing is set then a link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/tree/master/pkg/plugin/test-keeper/plugin/comment_message.go[default message] is used).

IMPORTANT: Both the configuration file and the file with plugin hint are always loaded from the `HEAD` of the Pull Request.

==== File patterns [[file-patterns]]

Both inclusions and exclusions can be specified in two formats - either in a wildcard format or in a regex.

===== Wildcard format
Wildcard format represents the whole file path using a combination of a star wildcard:

`**`:: wildcard for expressing "any directory"
`*`:: wildcard for expressing "any file name"

**Examples**

`**/*_test.go`:: matches any subdirectory containing a go file whose name ends with `_test`
`*_test.go`:: is same as the previous one - just a shorter version
`pkg/**/*_test.go`:: matches all `pkg` subdirectories containing a Go file whose name ends with `_test`
`vendor/`:: matches directory `vendor` and all its subdirectories and files located in it

===== Regular expressions

IMPORTANT: Don't use a regular expression inside of the wildcard format. We don't support it.

If the wildcard format is not suitable for you, you can still use regex, but it has to be surrounded by `regex{{...}}`.

Both formats can used together in list of patterns, e.g.:

[source, yml, indent=0]
----
test_patterns:
  - '**/__test.go'
  - 'regex{{.*test\.ts[x]?}}'
