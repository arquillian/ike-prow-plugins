== Sentry Logging

Plugins in this repository can be integrated with link:https://sentry.io/welcome/[Sentry] error tracking tool. Use following flags when starting a plugin service to enable it:

  * `sentry-dsn-file` - path to the file containing complete link:https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn[Sentry DSN]. Defaults to `/etc/sentry-dsn/sentry`.
  * `sentry-timeout` - Sentry server timeout in ms. Defaults to 1 second.
  * `env`  - environment name plugin is running in. Used e.g. by Sentry for tagging.

You will have to add `config/sentry.dsn` file in this repository so built-in `Makefile` targets will be able to populate DSN correctly to plugin pods.
