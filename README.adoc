== Prerequisites

You need to have following packages in place:

* `git`
* `make`
* `go` (`>= v1.10.2`)
* link:https://glide.sh/[`glide`] for dependency management
* link:https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter[`gometalinter`]

Assuming that you have all the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place (such as `$GOPATH`), clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins $GOPATH/src/github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins
----

NOTE: Have a look how link:https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration and
management of different versions of Go.

NOTE: You can also use link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/master/setup.sh[`setup.sh`] which takes care of all of the above. Simply execute +
`$ curl -sSL https://git.io/vxnSk | bash` +
and you are all set.

== Documentation

The complete documentation can be found at http://arquillian.org/ike-prow-plugins.

You can also generate it locally. All you need to have in place is https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker].
Then simply execute:

```
./.asciidoctor/generate.sh
```
and you are set. You will find generated documentation in the `gh-pages` folder.

On Linux you can combine it with following command:

```
./.asciidoctor/generate.sh && xdg-open gh-pages/index.html &>/dev/null
```

This will generate the documentation and open it in the browser.
