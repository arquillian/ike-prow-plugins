This repository is home for GitHub / PR automation plugins for Arquillian projects living in this organization. Those
plugins are based on link:https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow[Prow] sub project of
Kubernetes Test Infrastructure.

== Prerequisites

=== Tooling

You need to have following packages in place:

* `git`
* `make`
* `go` (`>= v1.9.4`)
* link:https://glide.sh/[`glide`] for dependency management
* link:https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter[`gometalinter`]

Assuming that you have all the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place (such as `$GOPATH`), clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins $GOPATH/src/github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins
----

NOTE: Have a look how link:https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration and
management of different versions of Go.

NOTE: You can also use `setup.sh` which takes care of all of the above

=== Plugin settings

In order to enable certain plugin for your repository or organization, you should edit `plugins.yaml` file adding:


[source,bash]
----
external_plugins:
  organization:
  - name: test-keeper <1>
  organization/repository <2>
  - name: label-sanitizer
----
<1> The `test-keeper` plugin will be applied to every repository in your organization.
<2> You can also specify plugins only for certain repositories (be aware however, that adding an external plugin both to the repository and its organization link:https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/7de525b1f6943e5d08d9a127b0b668cec404c665/prow/plugins/plugins_test.go#L143[will result in an error]).


==== GitHub settings [[gh-settings]]

You will need two secrets to be able to integrate with GitHub. The `config/hmac.token` file should contain the token that
you give to GitHub for validating webhooks. You can generate it using any reasonable randomness-generator, for example
link:http://random.org[random.org].

The `config/oauth.token` is an OAuth2 token that has read and write access to the GitHub account. Generate it from
link:https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[here]. Depending on your plugin needs the scopes might vary,
but it is important to have following scopes enabled: `admin:org_hook` and `admin:repo_hook`.

NOTE: Both of these files are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) so you can keep them in your repository, as some `make`
targets rely on them.

==== Setting up the web hook [[webhook]]

In order to setup webhook for your repository go to `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/settings/hooks/new` and provide:

* payload URL
* content type needs to be `application-json`
* secret the same as defined in `config/hmac.token` file
* customize types of hooks you would like to receive (or use all to start)

For hints how to test web hook against your local setup head over to <<testing-hooks>> section.

NOTE: More details about GitHub hooks can be found in the link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[official developer documentation].

== Development

=== Local Setup using Minishift

You can use Minishift for developing plugins locally.
Follow link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#installing-instructions[official installation guide] to set it up.

This setup is based on following versions:

[source,bash]
----
minishift v1.13.1
openshift v3.7.1
kubernetes v1.7.6
----

==== Initial setup

Before you start developing new plugins or evolving existing ones you need to deploy set of basic Prow services and configuration.

For this purpose use login to your Openshift cluster using `oc login` and execute `make oc-init` target which will:

* Create new project named `ike-prow-plugins`
* Add config maps for Prow configuration (`config.yaml`) and its plugins (`plugins.yaml`)
* Add required secrets (see <<gh-settings>> for details)
* Apply `cluster/starter.yaml` with basic Prow infra.

The key piece of this deployment is the `hook` service which listens to GitHub events and dispatches them to relevant plugins.

You will have to create a route for this service. Go to `Applications -> Services -> hook` and click `Create Route`.
Set `/hook` as a path and click `Create`.

==== Pushing to local Minishift repository

To speed up development cycle (and avoid pushing work-in-progress) images to Docker Hub you can use built-in docker repository available in Minishift.
`Makefile` and templates are adjusted to use it, so the only thing you have to do is to set up few environment variables.

IMPORTANT: Before executing `docker login` make sure you are logged in using token instead of regular password. That's returned
by `oc whoami -t` and is used as password by Docker daemon. To do that open OpenShift Console (e.g. `xdg-open https://$(minishift ip):8443/console &>/dev/null`),
click on your username in the upper-right corner and then `Copy Login Command`. Use it to login from the terminal and
you are ready to go.

[source,bash]
----
eval $(minishift docker-env)
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $(minishift openshift registry)
export REGISTRY=$(minishift openshift registry)
export DOCKER_REPO=$(oc get project --show-all=false -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2)
----


NOTE: If you are using `zsh` you can take a look at link:https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv[autoenv] or
link:https://direnv.net/[direnv] to automate this setup every time you access project's directory. Just make sure to add it to your global `.gitignore` to avoid sharing it through PRs (e.g. `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`).


=== Building

In order to compile the project simply execute `make build` target. This will compile, run tests and put binaries of each
plugin in `/bin` directory in the root of the project. There is also a quick compile option (`make compile-only`) where
`go build` is only invoked, skipping other targets like `tests` and `checks`

You can also automatically format and remove unused imports by invoking `goimports` tool (`make imports`).

IMPORTANT: `goimports` does not correctly handle import of packages where package name differs from last part of the URL
provided. For example `import "gopkg.in/h2non/gock.v1"` will be removed. To overcome this problem name the import `import gock "gopkg.in/h2non/gock.v1"`. One of the related issues link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9882[go/issues/9882].

To deploy plugins use `make oc-apply`. This will build images, push them to the repository, generate deployments and apply
them on the cluster. This target builds all plugins at once.

IMPORTANT: You have to be logged in to the cluster first.

=== Developing new plugin

Besides creating new folders/packages in `plugin` folder you will have to register your plugin in the `Makefile`. Simply
add its name to link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/308909d88c7bee02b96236121fd25d4e9d08d88b/Makefile#L4[this list] and you should be good.

IMPORTANT: By convention internal `PluginName`, the directory where the code is located and name of the service are assumed to
be the same.

=== Testing

We use link:https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/[Ginkgo] testing framework and link:https://onsi.github.io/gomega/[Gomega] assertion library for writing tests.

Make sure you have both installed locally in order to execute tests from the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get -u github.com/onsi/gomega
----

==== Testing hints

* To run all tests at once execute `ginkgo -r` on the root of the project.
* `ginkgo watch -r` will watch on tests changes recursively starting from the directory the command was invoked. It will re-run the tests whenever change in the code occurs
* In order to execute one test rename `It` function to `FIt`. Ginkgo runner will only execute given test (focused) instead of the whole test suite. This also works with `Context` and `Describe` blocks.
* To exclude prefix any of the blocks with `X`.

==== Testing hooks [[testing-hooks]]

You can consume GitHub events through webhook pointing to your local cluster. For this purpose use
link:http://www.ultrahook.com/[`ultrahook`]. After registering your own API key simply run following command and you
are all set:

[source,bash]
----
ultrahook github http://hook-$(oc get project --show-all=false -o name | grep 'prow' | cut -d'/' -f 2).$(minishift ip).nip.io/hook
----

NOTE: If not done before add ultrahook URL as payload URL for webhook configuration (see <<webhook>>).

Having this set up you will start seeing events triggered by your actions in the repository and
corresponding plugins reacting on them. Have a look at pods logs to verify if everything is working expected.

== Documentation

You can generate it locally. All you need to have in place is https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker].
Simply execute

```
$ ./.asciidoctor/generate.sh
```
and you are set. You will find generated documentation in the `gh-pages` folder.

On Linux you can combine it with following command:

```
./.asciidoctor/generate.sh && xdg-open gh-pages/index.html &>/dev/null
```

This will generate the documentation and open it in the browser.
