== Ike Prow Plugins

This repository is home for GitHub / PR automation plugins for Arquillian projects living in this organization. Those
plugins are based on link:https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow[Prow] sub project of
Kubernetes Test Infrastructure.

=== Prerequisites

==== Tooling

You need to have following packages in place:

* `git`
* `make`
* `go` (>= v1.9.4)
* link:https://glide.sh/[`glide`] for dependency management

Assuming that you have all the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place (such as `$GOPATH`), clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins $GOPATH/src/github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins
----

NOTE: Have a look how link:https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration and
management of different versions of Go.

NOTE: You can also use `setup.sh` which takes care of all of the above

==== GitHub settings [[gh-settings]]

You will need two secrets to be able to integrate with GitHub. The `hmac.token` file should contain the token that
you give to GitHub for validating webhooks. You can generate it using any reasonable randomness-generator, for example
link:http://random.org[random.org].

The `oauth.token` is an OAuth2 token that has read and write access to the GitHub account. Generate it from
link:https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[here].

NOTE: Both of these files are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) so you can keep them in your repository, as some `make`
targets rely on them.

=== Local Setup

==== Minishift

You can use Minishift for developing plugins locally.
Follow link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#installing-instructions[official installation guide] to set it up.

This setup is based on following versions:

[source,bash]
----
minishift v1.13.1
openshift v3.7.1
kubernetes v1.7.6
----

===== Initial setup

Before you start developing new plugins or evolving existing ones you need to deploy set of basic Prow services and configuration.

For this purpose use login to your Openshift cluster using `oc login` and execute `make oc-init` target which will:

* Create new project named `ike-prow-plugins`
* Add config maps for Prow configuration (`config.yaml`) and its plugins (`plugins.yaml`)
* Add required secrets (see <<gh-settings>> for details)
* Apply `cluster/starter.yaml` with basic Prow infra.

The key piece of this deployment is the `hook` service which listens to GitHub events and dispatches them to relevant plugins.

You will have to create a route for this service. Go to `Applications -> Services -> hook` and click `Create Route`.
Set `/hook` as a path and click `Create`.

===== Pushing to local Minishift repository

To speed up development cycle (and avoid pushing work-in-progress) images to Docker Hub you can use built-in docker repository available in Minishift.
`Makefile` and templates are adjusted to use it, so the only thing you have to do is to set up few environment variables.

IMPORTANT: Before executing `docker login` make sure you are logged in using token instead of regular password. That's returned
by `oc whoami -t` and is used as password by Docker daemon. To do that open OpenShift Console (e.g. `xdg-open https://$(minishift ip):8443/console &>/dev/null`),
click on your username in the upper-right corner and then `Copy Login Command`. Use it to login from the terminal and
you are ready to go.

[source,bash]
----
eval $(minishift docker-env)
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $(minishift openshift registry)
export REGISTRY=$(minishift openshift registry)
export DOCKER_REPO=$(oc get project --show-all=false -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2)
----


NOTE: If you are using `zsh` you can take a look at link:https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv[autoenv] or
link:https://direnv.net/[direnv] to automate this setup every time you access project's directory.

=== Testing hooks

You can consume GitHub events through webhook pointing to your local cluster. For this purpose use
link:http://www.ultrahook.com/[`ultrahook`]. After registering your own API key simply run following command and you
are all set:

[source,bash]
----
ultrahook github http://hook-$(oc get project --show-all=false -o name | grep 'prow' | cut -d'/' -f 2).$(minishift ip).nip.io/hook
----

Having this set up you will start seeing events trigger by your actions in the repository coming in and
corresponding plugins reacting on them. Have a look at pods logs to verify if everything is working expected.

=== Building

In order to compile the project simply execute `make build` target. This will compile, run tests and put binaries of each
plugin in `/bin` directory in the root of the project.

To deploy plugins use `make oc-apply`. This will build images, push them to the repository, generate deployments and apply
them on the cluster. This target builds all plugins at once.

IMPORTANT: You have to be logged in to the cluster first.

=== Developing new plugin

Besides creating new folders/packages in `plugin` folder you will have to register your plugin in the `Makefile`. Simply
add its name to link:https://github.com/arquillian/ike-prow-plugins/blob/308909d88c7bee02b96236121fd25d4e9d08d88b/Makefile#L4[this list] and you should be good.

IMPORTANT: By convention internal `PluginName`, the directory where the code is located and name of the service are assumed to
be the same.
